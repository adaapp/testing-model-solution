# Task Three - Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development (50%)

Your task is to implement a holiday booking system using JavaScript classes, which is fully-covered by unit tests. A specification for the interface is given below. Aim to implement the spec exactly (and if you need to deviate from it for some reason, be sure to leave a comment in the test explaining your decision and rationale).

The vast majority of marks will be awarded for:

- The design and structure of your ​tests​​.
- Your test ​coverage​​ and correct use of Mocha/Chai.
- The neatness, readability and quality of your code.

A few marks are also available for:

- The design and structure of your classes and functions.
- The quality of your "boilerplate" code (README.md, package.json, folder structure etc)

## Running the tests and REPL

```shell
npm install
npm test
```

You can also load a REPL with the classes required by running

```
npm start
```
